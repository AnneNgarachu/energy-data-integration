Energy Data Integration
This project aims to build a scalable and flexible platform for integrating energy data from various sources, including SystemsLink Energy Manager, Automatic Meter Reading (AMR), Manual Meter Reads, and SmartSpaces Alarms. The goal is to provide a centralized system that can collect, standardize, and analyze energy consumption and emissions data across multiple organizations and industries.
The key features of this project include:

Unified Data Model: A standardized data structure that can accommodate energy data from diverse sources, allowing for seamless integration and analysis.
Connectors and Integrations: Customizable connectors to fetch data from various energy management systems, with a focus on ease of use and extensibility.
Emissions Calculations: Automated emissions calculations based on industry-standard conversion factors, providing organizations with insights into their carbon footprint.
Reporting and Analytics: Comprehensive reporting capabilities, including emissions tracking, trend analysis, and comparative reporting across organizations and industries.
Compliance and Security: Robust data validation, anonymization, and secure storage to ensure regulatory compliance and data privacy.
Scalability and Extensibility: A modular and flexible architecture that can accommodate the needs of diverse organizations, from small businesses to large enterprises.
